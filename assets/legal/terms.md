If you disagree to be bound by the modified Terms and Conditions, you may no longer use the product or Service. Because our development and Services are evolving, we may change or discontinue all or any part of the product or Service, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.

If you violate any of the terms and conditions, we can terminate your Account at our sole discretion. You agree to use the Product or Service at your own risk.

For monthly payment plans, we will bill you in advance every month. Payment is non-refundable. We don’t issue refunds or credits for partial months of service, refunds for upgrading or downgrading your paid plan, or refunds for unused months with an open Account. Suppose you have a paid plan for a specific number of users, and your number increases between billing periods such that your devices exceed the number your schedule allows. In that case, we will charge you in arrears at the end of that period for any users that exceed the number permitted by your plan during that prior billing period. Note that this arrears billing is in addition to the billing in advance for your monthly plan. When changing from a monthly billing cycle to a yearly one, Swayatt Drishtigochar will bill for an entire year at the next monthly billing date.

All fees do not include any taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities (federal, state, or county), and you will be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding United States and India taxes.

Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Swayatt Drishtigochar does not accept any liability for such loss.

### **Cancellation and Termination**

* Swayatt Drishtigochar, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your Account and refuse any current or future use of the Product and Service or any other Swayatt Drishtigochar service for any reason. Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your Account and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all User Content in your Account.
* If your Account is in good standing, Swayatt Drishtigochar may, in its sole discretion and without obligation, repay the unused portion of any prepaid fees for the Product or Service.
